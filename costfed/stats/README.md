For each property **p &isin; P** in a dataset **D**, the set of subjects is defined as:

![set of subjects](formulas/s_p.png)

Then, we computed the mean and standard deviation of the frequency of their respective objects (o). The mean frequency of the objects of a property **p** is defined as

![mean frequency](formulas/mf_o_p.png)

whereas the standard deviation is

![std frequency](formulas/sdf_o_p.png)

Afterwards, for each dataset, we calculated the following indices:

* *net-mean mean frequency*

![net mean frequency](formulas/nmf_o_d.png)

* *net-mean standard deviation of frequency*

![net std frequency](formulas/nsdf_o_d.png)

* *net-mean coefficient of variation*, defined as the rate between **nsdf** and **nmf**.

We repeated the steps above also in the other direction, i.e. extracting the objects first and computing the indices for the subjects (s).

As the **ncv** values are way above 0 in almost all cases, 
we can safely assume that the distribution of subjects and objects is not homogeneous.
